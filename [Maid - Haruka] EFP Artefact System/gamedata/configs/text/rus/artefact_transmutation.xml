			\n%c[pda_green]Information%c[ui_gray_1]
			\nThe Artefact Transmutator a result of many experiments with artefacts, created to facilitate the alteration of their properties through exposure to particles of similar elements.\n
			\nThe technological advacements during the experimentation with artefact properties and internal structure allowed to create this compact protorype which can be attached to your regular artefact detectors.\n
			\n%c[pda_blue]Functionality%c[ui_gray_1]\n
			\nThe transmutator device database can be updated to cover more transmutations with the recipes you acquire, it can be attached and removed to your detector for such reason.\n
			\nï Scanning - analyzes and displays the artefacts an anomaly can potentially create.
			\nï Transmutating - allows your detector to emit a pulse of particles that activates the artefacts internal properties, to mutate and enhance it's capabilities.\n
			\nKeep in mind that these functionalities depend on the artefacts discovered and the detector's capabilities.
			\nIn most cases for a succesful transmutation you need to first scan an anomaly, then the list of artefacts will be displayed, those would be artefacts that you can transmute in that anomaly if you have the recipe. Some recipes are special and require different conditions.
